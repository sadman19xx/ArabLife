ROLE_IDS_ALLOWED=role_id1,role_id2                  # Comma-separated list of role IDs allowed to use role commands
ROLE_COMMAND_COOLDOWN=60                            # Cooldown between role commands in seconds (default: 60)

# Voice System Configuration
#------------------------

# Welcome Sound Settings
WELCOME_SOUND_PATH=welcome.mp3          # Path to welcome sound file (relative to bot directory)
WELCOME_SOUND_VOLUME=0.5                # Welcome sound volume (0.1 to 2.0, default: 0.5)
DEFAULT_VOLUME=0.5                      # Default volume for all sounds (0.1 to 2.0)

# FFmpeg Configuration for Ubuntu
# Install FFmpeg if not already installed:
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
#
# FFmpeg is required for voice functionality. Path will be auto-detected in this order:
# 1. Value of FFMPEG_PATH if set
# 2. System PATH
# 3. Ubuntu default location (/usr/bin/ffmpeg)
# 4. Falls back to 'ffmpeg' command
FFMPEG_PATH=/usr/bin/ffmpeg             # Default Ubuntu FFmpeg path

# Voice Connection Settings
VOICE_TIMEOUT=30                        # Voice connection timeout in seconds (increased for stability)
MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS=5                # Maximum number of reconnection attempts
RECONNECT_DELAY=5                       # Initial delay between reconnection attempts (seconds)
MAX_RECONNECT_DELAY=60                  # Maximum delay between reconnection attempts (seconds)

# Voice Connection Recovery
# The bot implements a robust connection management system:
# 1. Connection verification before any operation
# 2. Automatic undeafening if bot gets deafened
# 3. Session tracking and cleanup
# 4. Exponential backoff for reconnection:
#    - First attempt: RECONNECT_DELAY seconds (5s)
#    - Second attempt: RECONNECT_DELAY * 2 seconds (10s)
#    - Third attempt: RECONNECT_DELAY * 4 seconds (20s)
#    And so on, up to MAX_RECONNECT_DELAY (60s)
# 5. After MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS, use !rejoin command for manual intervention

# Voice Health Checks
# The bot performs regular health checks:
# - Connection verification every 5 seconds
# - Deafen state check every 2 seconds
# - Websocket health monitoring
# - Keep-alive management
# - Automatic cleanup of stale connections

# Logging Settings for Ubuntu
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR). Default: INFO
LOG_TO_FILE=true             # Recommended true for Ubuntu production setup
LOG_DIR=/var/log/arablife    # Ubuntu standard log directory (requires proper permissions)

# Note: For Ubuntu production setup:
# 1. Create log directory: sudo mkdir -p /var/log/arablife
# 2. Set permissions: sudo chown -R your_user:your_user /var/log/arablife
# 3. Install required packages: sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip ffmpeg
# 4. Ensure bot has proper permissions to access voice channels
# 5. Verify FFmpeg installation: ffmpeg -version
